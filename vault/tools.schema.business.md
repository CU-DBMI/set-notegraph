Business schemas center around our use of apps such as [[Mondaydotcom|apps.mondaydotcom]], [[Smartsheet|apps.Smartsheet]], Basecamp, and others.

The primary schema is the `report` schema, [[vault\tools.schema.business.effort_hours.report.json]], which collects all Tasks by Resource by Project, per Client.
