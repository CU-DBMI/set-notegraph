## Summary

This page provides notes surrounding "Team Science" as a model for performing scientific research.

See below for some definitions of Team Science.

>Team science is a collaborative effort to address a scientific challenge that leverages the strengths and expertise of professionals, oftentimes trained in different fields. ([_https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/research/team-science-toolkit/what-is-team-science_](https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/research/team-science-toolkit/what-is-team-science))

>Team science initiatives are designed to promote collaborative, and often cross-disciplinary (which includes multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary) approaches to answering research questions about particular phenomena. ([_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_team_science_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_team_science))

## Science of Team Science (SciTS)

It's important to note that the Science of Team Science is treated as a separate area of study:

>The SciTS field, on the other hand, is concerned with understanding and managing circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of collaborative science, and evaluating the outcomes of collaborative science.([_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_team_science_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_team_science))
