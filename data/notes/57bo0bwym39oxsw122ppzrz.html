<p>Notes about using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects">Github Projects</a> for work visibility and planning.</p>
<p>Github Projects allows you to collect, organize and visualize existing or upcoming repository issues in one spot. Project spaces may be created at the repo, user, or organization level.</p>
<p>Github Projects is segmented by two historical versions: "legacy" and "current/existing". Legacy acts slightly different than the current/existing version.</p>

<p>Much of Github Projects is aimed at a single repository or organization's issues but there are ways to integrate external issues into projects.</p>
<p>One way to do this is by using the Github Issue URL and pasting this into the Github Project directly as a new issue row, which can be automatically ingested as an existing issue within the board. Note: For issues imported in this way, the Project may not appear alongside the issue from it's display in the external organization.</p>
