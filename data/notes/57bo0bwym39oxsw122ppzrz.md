Notes about using [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) for work visibility and planning.

Github Projects allows you to collect, organize and visualize existing or upcoming repository issues in one spot. Project spaces may be created at the repo, user, or organization level.

Github Projects is segmented by two historical versions: "legacy" and "current/existing". Legacy acts slightly different than the current/existing version.

## Cross-Organizational Use for External Issues

Much of Github Projects is aimed at a single repository or organization's issues but there are ways to integrate external issues into projects.

One way to do this is by using the Github Issue URL and pasting this into the Github Project directly as a new issue row, which can be automatically ingested as an existing issue within the board. Note: For issues imported in this way, the Project may not appear alongside the issue from it's display in the external organization.
