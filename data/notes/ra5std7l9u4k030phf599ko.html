<p>Build tools for Python Environments. In order to ensure reproducibility, a Python developer might make use of specific build tools for their environment. These tools generally try to make sure Python binaries, packages, versions, and cross-dependencies are maintained and source controlled where possible. They also greatly enhance specifications sometimes found within <code>requirements.txt</code> files. For more information, see: <a href="https://modelpredict.com/wht-requirements-txt-is-not-enough">Why requirements.txt isn't enough</a>.</p>
<p>Below is a list of just a few of these tools. Please note: there is not always feature parity between these, it's recommended to only use at your own discretion after investigation.</p>
