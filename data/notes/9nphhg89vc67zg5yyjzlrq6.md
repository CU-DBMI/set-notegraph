- [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org)
- [Dagster](https://www.dagster.io)
- DVC (Data Pipelines)
- Elyra

- Metaflow
- [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io)

[DBT](https://www.getdbt.com) is an "data transformation tool," more focused on flowing SQL and database data, but very powerful there.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), a Java tool, is especially liked in the academic research community.

Useful in the academic and research environment, we've run across [SnakeMake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

[Ray Workflows](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/workflows/basics.html) - Part of the Ray distributed compute project.
