_Rough sketch of research lifecycle based on below references._

This page provides notes surrounding the "Research Lifecycle" as a heuristic model for working through research projects.

> The Research Lifecycle is a heuristic model for understanding the steps of the process of scientific discovery (research), often represented in a wheel to emphasize the continuous nature of research with one project leading into the next.

Intepretations of the Research Lifecycle vary in their steps. Below are some references from various groups and institutions.
