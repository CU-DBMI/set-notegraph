<p>This page provides notes surrounding "Team Science" as a methodology for performing scientific research.</p>
<p>See below for some definitions of Team Science.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team science is a collaborative effort to address a scientific challenge that leverages the strengths and expertise of professionals, oftentimes trained in different fields. (<a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/research/team-science-toolkit/what-is-team-science"><em>https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/research/team-science-toolkit/what-is-team-science</em></a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Team science initiatives are designed to promote collaborative, and often cross-disciplinary (which includes multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinary) approaches to answering research questions about particular phenomena.

<p>It's important to note that the Science of Team Science is treated as a separate area of study:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SciTS field, on the other hand, is concerned with understanding and managing circumstances that facilitate or hinder the effectiveness of collaborative science, and evaluating the outcomes of collaborative science.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_team_science"><em>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_of_team_science</em></a>)</p>
